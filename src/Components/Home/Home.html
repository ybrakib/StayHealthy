              <h2>Improve Your Diet Starting Today</h2> <p>There are many foods that we love to eat but just are not healthy enough to indulge infrequently. Burgers, fries, and sweets are among some of our go-to food favorites. Eating these kinds of foods often can lead to a poor diet and some serious health issues.<br> <span id="more-37723"></span></p> <h2>Ready to improve your diet?</h2> <p>Luckily, there are ways to indulge in these foods healthily without feeling guilty. Check out this list of <a href="https://diyactive.com/five-ways-your-pet-can-improve-your-physical-and-mental-health/" data-wpel-link="internal">ways you can improve</a> your diet without cutting out your favorite foods!</p> <h3>1. Try a Non-Beef Burger Option</h3> <p>Burgers are uncontestably delicious. Typically, most burgers are made with beef, but this does not have to be the case. Eating a large amount of red meat can take a toll on your digestive system.</p> <p>There are lots of healthier options to a standard beef burger, <a href="https://diyactive.com/turkey-burgers-with-peaches/" data-wpel-link="internal">including turkey burgers</a> and various different veggie burger options, like veggie patties or portobello mushroom and halloumi.</p> <p>If you are an avid burger lover, think about trying one of these alternative options next time you are hosting a cookout.</p> <h3>2. Buy an Air Fryer</h3> <p>It is a well-known fact that fried foods are full of fat and an excess of oil that is unhealthy for the body.</p> <p>This being said, fried foods are also delicious, and it can be difficult to find the willpower to completely cut them out of your diet. Instead of frying your next batch of foods in a traditional fryer, think about purchasing an air fryer for your frying needs.</p> <p>Air fryers give you a way to fry your food without any oil at all. Air fryers are extremely easy to use and are a great way to enjoy your favorite fried treats without the unhealthy consequences.</p> <h3>3. Incorporate Fruits into Your Desserts</h3> <p>We love a dessert because it’s a sweet snack to enjoy at the end of a long day. However, sweets can quickly become unhealthy when not eaten in moderation due to their high sugar content.</p> <p>Next time you are thinking about dessert, consider eating fruit instead or incorporating fruits into your dessert. Using fruits and their natural sugars can help cut out the added sugar in desserts. This is a great way to enjoy a sweet snack without feeling guilty.</p> <h3>4. Reduce Your Salt Intake</h3> <p>Too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and the frequency of your sugar cravings. Most of us are eating far more salt than the daily 1,500 milligrams recommended.</p> <p>Next time you are cooking, try being mindful of the amount of salt you are adding to your food.</p> <h3>5. Use the Peels of Vegetables</h3> <p>Vegetable peels are full of vitamins and nutrients that are often wasted because we throw them away.</p> <p>Incorporating the peels of all kinds of vegetables and other foods can easily increase the number of nutrients in your diet. Often, the skins offer more nutrients than what’s inside! Next time you want potato fries, try making your own with the skins on.</p> <p>This is an easy way to reduce waste and improve your diet at the same time.</p> 
              
              <h3>6. Try Eating Anti-Inflammatory Foods</h3> <p>There are many <a href="https://diyactive.com/7-natural-anti-inflammatory-foods-to-ease-arthritis-pain/" data-wpel-link="internal">anti-inflammatory foods</a> that we already love, so it is easy to incorporate them into your diet more frequently.</p> <p>These foods have more omega-3 acids compared to others, which helps increase your immune system. Some of our favorite anti-inflammatory foods include walnuts, salmon, tofu, and flaxseeds.</p> <h3>7. Try Out Meatless Monday</h3> <p>Incorporating one vegetarian meal into your diet a week can help improve your health greatly. The idea is that by ditching the meat once a week, you are ultimately increasing your vegetable intake.</p> <p>We suggest trying out a stuffed bell pepper with risotto, making your own healthy veggie pizzas, or making a large and delicious salad to start out your meatless Mondays.</p> <h2>Wrap-Up</h2> <p>So, are you ready to start improving your diet? Start with small, baby steps and grow from there!</p>
